<h3>Adding Children to your account: </h3>
<hr>
<p>This is for signing up. You can add a child to this account, and the point of this is to tailor programs offered by the city. For instance, a child aged 0-2 would have different programs than one aged 4-7.</p>

<h3>Changing between your children: </h3>
<hr>
<p> Parents can have multiple children, so we added an ability to add multiple children, and switch views easily. You can see the programs offered specifically for that child. </p>
